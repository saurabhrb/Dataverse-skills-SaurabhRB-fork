# Contributing to Dataverse Skills

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to agree to a

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/microsoft/Dataverse-skills/issues) to report bugs or suggest features
- Search existing issues before creating new ones
- Include as much detail as possible: environment, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior

### Contributing Skills

We welcome new skill contributions! To add a new skill:

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch from `main`
2. **Create a new skill folder** under `.github/plugins/dataverse/skills/` following the naming convention: `your-skill-name/`
3. **Create a `SKILL.md` file** with the required frontmatter and instructions (see existing skills as reference)
4. **Follow the skill structure**:
   - YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, and `metadata`
   - Clear step-by-step instructions
   - SDK-first approach: use `PowerPlatform-Dataverse-Client` for all supported operations, raw Web API only for gaps
   - Output formatting examples
5. **Test locally** using `claude --plugin-dir` (see [Local Development](#local-development) below)
6. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of what the skill does and why it's useful

### Improving Existing Skills

- Fix bugs or edge cases in existing skill logic
- Improve SDK usage patterns or query efficiency
- Add additional edge case handling
- Enhance MCP configuration or auth flows

### Documentation

- Fix typos or unclear instructions
- Add usage examples
- Improve README or skill documentation

## Pull Request Process

1. Update relevant documentation if your change affects usage
2. Ensure your skill follows the existing formatting patterns
3. Test your changes locally with `claude --plugin-dir` (see [Local Development](#local-development) below)
4. Your PR will be reviewed by maintainers
5. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your contribution

## Local Development

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/Dataverse-skills.git
```

Then run the plugin against your local clone with the agent you're testing. The agents differ in how they load plugins from a local path: Claude Code reads the plugin directory on every launch, so edits are picked up automatically. Copilot copies the plugin into its store at install time, so refreshing after edits requires uninstall + reinstall.

### Testing with GitHub Copilot CLI

Install directly from your local plugin directory:

```bash
copilot plugin install <path/to/repo>/.github/plugins/dataverse
```

After making local changes (or pulling), uninstall and reinstall to refresh Copilot's copy:

```bash
copilot plugin uninstall dataverse@dataverse-skills
copilot plugin install <path/to/repo>/.github/plugins/dataverse
```

### Testing with Claude Code

Launch Claude Code with the plugin loaded from your local clone — no install or uninstall needed; edits take effect on the next launch:

```bash
# In a fresh test folder
mkdir my-test-project && cd my-test-project

claude --plugin-dir "<path/to/repo>/.github/plugins/dataverse"
```

Quote the path if it contains spaces or special characters; use an absolute path.

### Testing with Gemini CLI

The canonical plugin directory is also the Gemini extension root, so local
development does not require a copied compatibility tree. Validate and link it
directly. CI validates it with the current Gemini CLI npm `latest` release:

```bash
gemini extensions validate .github/plugins/dataverse
gemini extensions link .github/plugins/dataverse
gemini extensions config dataverse DATAVERSE_URL --scope workspace
```

Restart Gemini after linking. Use `/extensions list`, `/skills list`, and
`gemini mcp list` to verify discovery. Do not commit the environment URL stored
by Gemini's local extension settings.

### Testing with Codex

Add your local clone as a marketplace source, then browse `/plugins` and install `dataverse`:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add <path/to/repo>
```

In the **Codex app**, do the same through **Plugins → Add marketplace**: set **Source** to your local clone path (or the repo's HTTPS URL), leave **Sparse paths** empty, then install `dataverse` from the marketplace.

Codex discovers the plugin via the repo-root `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` (its native marketplace path; it falls back to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` if that's absent) and loads it through the native `.github/plugins/dataverse/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` manifest. Like Copilot, Codex caches the plugin at install time, so run `codex plugin marketplace upgrade dataverse-skills` after local edits to refresh.

### Testing with Google Antigravity

Install the canonical plugin directory from your local clone:

```bash
agy plugin install <path/to/repo>/.github/plugins/dataverse
```

Restart `agy`, verify the nine Dataverse skills with `/skills`, and run
`/dv-connect`. Reinstall after source edits because Antigravity stages a copy of
the plugin rather than linking the working tree.
