# Dataverse Skills

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Build, query, and manage [Microsoft Dataverse](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-intro) and linked Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations environments through natural language. The plugin teaches AI coding agents to drive the Dataverse MCP server, Dataverse CLI, Python SDK, and PAC CLI — from designing data models and answering CRM questions to deploying Dataverse solutions and Finance and Operations deployable packages.

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| **dv-connect** | One-time setup that installs the Dataverse CLI, Python SDK, and PAC CLI; authenticates against your Dataverse environment; and registers the Dataverse MCP server with your agent. |
| **dv-query** | Reads, filters, paginates, and aggregates Dataverse records. Handles natural-language questions like *"show me my open deals"*, multi-page result sets, and pandas DataFrame loading for notebook analysis. |
| **dv-data** | Single-record CRUD plus bulk import — CSV loads, multi-table imports with foreign-key dependencies, upsert by alternate key, and AI-generated sample data. |
| **dv-metadata** | Authors and edits the Dataverse data model: tables, columns, relationships, forms, and views. |
| **dv-solution** | Manages solution lifecycle — create, export, import, promote across environments, and validate deployments. |
| **erp-xpp** | Handles the Finance and Operations X++ lifecycle: model and metadata authoring, matching SDK installation, compile/build, deployable package deployment, database synchronization, and verification of custom services/APIs, runnable X++ classes, and public OData data entities. |
| **dv-admin** | Environment-level administration: bulk delete, retention/archival, organization settings, OrgDB settings, recycle bin, audit, and the allowlisted PPAC toggles. |
| **dv-security** | Assigns security roles, manages user access, adds application users, configures business units, and handles admin self-elevation. |
| **dv-overview** | Cross-cutting rules and tool routing; loaded before any other skill to direct each request to the right specialist. |

## Prerequisites

A Microsoft Dataverse environment, available through Power Apps, Dynamics 365, or Power Platform plans, or via the free [Power Apps Developer Plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/developer/plan).

## Install

### GitHub Copilot

```bash
/plugin install dataverse@awesome-copilot
```

### Claude Code

```bash
/plugin install dataverse@claude-plugins-official
```

### Gemini CLI

Install the extension from the public repository. Gemini CLI selects the
generic extension archive attached to the latest GitHub Release:

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/microsoft/Dataverse-skills --skip-settings
gemini extensions config dataverse DATAVERSE_URL --scope workspace
```

Enter the Dataverse environment URL when the configuration command prompts.
The value is stored in local Gemini extension settings and is not committed to
the repository. Restart Gemini after installation, then verify discovery:

```text
/extensions list
/skills list
```

```bash
gemini mcp list
```

Update or uninstall the extension with:

```bash
gemini extensions update dataverse
gemini extensions uninstall dataverse
```

The release archive is generated from `.github/plugins/dataverse/` when a new
plugin version reaches `main`; the repository does not track a second skills or
scripts tree.

### Codex

**Codex app and ChatGPT**

1. Open **Plugins**.
2. Search for **Microsoft Dataverse** in the OpenAI plugin directory.
3. Open the `dataverse` plugin and select **Install**.

**Codex CLI**

Install directly from the OpenAI-curated marketplace:

```bash
codex plugin add dataverse@openai-curated
```

Alternatively, run `/plugins`, search for **Microsoft Dataverse**, and install
`dataverse` from the `openai-curated` marketplace.

### Cursor

**From agent chat**

```bash
/add-plugin dataverse
```

**From the marketplace UI**

1. Open **Settings → Plugins** in Cursor.
2. Search the Marketplace for **Dataverse**.
3. Open **Microsoft Dataverse** and select **Add to Cursor**.

The listing is published at [cursor.com/marketplace/microsoft-dataverse](https://cursor.com/marketplace/microsoft-dataverse).

### Google Antigravity

Install the native plugin directly from its canonical directory in this repository:

```bash
agy plugin install https://github.com/microsoft/Dataverse-skills/tree/main/.github/plugins/dataverse
```

Restart `agy`, then use `/skills` to verify discovery. Invoke `/dv-connect` to
select an environment and register the Dataverse MCP server with `agy mcp add`;
verify it with `agy mcp list` after restarting.

## Verify the install

After installation, ask your agent:

> "Connect to Dataverse"

The `dv-connect` skill walks through tool checks, authentication, and MCP registration. When it finishes, you should see a `dataverse-<orgname>` MCP server registered with your agent, and `pac auth list` should show your active environment.

## Try these prompts

After the connect flow finishes, describe what you want — the plugin picks MCP, the Dataverse CLI, the Python SDK, or PAC CLI for you.

- *"Show me my open deals over $100K closing this quarter"*
- *"Import this CSV into the contacts table"*
- *"Create a customer feedback table with name, rating, and comment columns"*
- *"Pull the schema and pack it into a solution"*
- *"Create a runnable X++ class, compile it, and deploy its Finance and Operations package"*
- *"Bulk delete activities older than 2024"*
- *"Add a teammate to the sales team on the dev environment"*

## Safety & Security

The plugin is designed around a least-privilege model — it cannot exceed the permissions of the authenticated user. Key safeguards:

- **MCP authorization** — MCP access requires developer auth, tenant admin consent, and per-environment allowlisting; other plugin tools (SDK, PAC CLI) authenticate directly.
- **Security role enforcement** — every API call is authorized server-side by Dataverse; the plugin cannot bypass or escalate permissions.
- **Application-level telemetry only** — outbound Dataverse requests may carry application metadata (plugin / version / skill / agent labels) so server-side dashboards can attribute traffic. No prompts, tool arguments, or record data are transmitted.
- **Token security** — credentials are stored in your OS native credential store or held in memory only; never passed to external services.

For the full safety model — including confirmation flows, logging, irreversible operation handling, and planned improvements — see [docs/safety-and-guardrails.md](docs/safety-and-guardrails.md).
